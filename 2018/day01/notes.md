# Day 1: Chronal Calibration

<https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/1>

Easy one to start. We have a list of numerical deltas, and have to apply it
to a variable. Part 1 is to apply the entire list and determine the final
value; part 2 is to repeat until finding a duplicate value.

The examples and the input have different formats; in the problem
description the input is a single line of comma-separated values, while the
actual problem input has one value per line.

```
$ perl day01.pl < input 
Part 1 result: 529
Part 2 result: 464
```
