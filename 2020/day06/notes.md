# Day 6: Custom Customs

[This one](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/6) is a trivial one; just need
to split up the groups and then count (1) the number of unique letters, and
(2) the number of letters that are shared between each line in the group.

```
$ perl day6.pl < input.txt 
part 1 result: 6587
part 2 result: 3235
```
