# Advent of Code

This repository is to collect my solutions for the yearly
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) challenge.

I'm starting this repository afresh in 2022; I'm planning to tackle the
2015 problems (from before I started participating) and document my thinking
along the way.

I usually write my solutions in Perl.  Typically the directories look like:

```
| root
|-- 2015
|   |-- day1
|   |   |-- day1-1.pl  # solution for day 1, part 1
|   |   |-- day1-2.pl  # solution for day 1, part 2
|   |   |-- test.txt   # test input provided for the question
|   |   |-- input.txt  # puzzle input
|   |   |-- notes.md   # any notes about the question and solution
|   |
|   |-- day2
|   ...
|
|-- 2016
...
```

Most of the solutions expect to receive their input data from standard
input. Occasionally there are other parameters that will be read from the
command line.
