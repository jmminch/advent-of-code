# Day 20: Donut Maze

<https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/20>

The ugliest part of this one is analyzing the map to put together the labels
which may be vertical or horizontal. Once that's done, finding the shortest
path is simple.

```
$ time perl day20.pl input 
Part 1 result: 608
Part 2 result: 6706

real	0m1.601s
user	0m1.589s
sys	0m0.012s
