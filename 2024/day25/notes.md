# Day 25: Code Chronicle

<https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/25>

This problem is mostly just an exercise in parsing the text input correctly;
it's a pretty simple problem to end the year with.

```
$ perl day25.pl input 
Part 1 result: 2770
```

Overall, this year's problems were probably easier than usual. Days 17, 21,
23 and 24 are the only ones that had much real difficulty in my mind.

One thing that I noticed is that there weren't any cellular automata
problems this year, which is unusual--usually there's at least one.
